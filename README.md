# git-better

## Overview

A set of opinionated wrappers to speed up and improve `git` usage.

Usable as both a library (`import git_better as git`)
and a command-line tool (`alias git=git-better`).

## Currently implemented

`git vanilla-clone`, offering nothing beneficial over regular `git clone`.
Do not ship, only for testing purposes.
